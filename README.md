# Spring Boot and React App.

## Objective
üéØ The objective of this project is to create a full-stack web application using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Introduction
‚ÑπÔ∏è This repository contains the source code for a web application built using Spring Boot and React. It combines the power of Java for the backend logic with the dynamic and interactive user interface provided by React.

## Topics
- Setting up Spring Boot project
- Setting up React project
- Integrating Spring Boot backend with React frontend
- Implementing RESTful APIs
- Managing entities and database operations
- Frontend UI design and interaction
- Authentication and authorization
- Deployment strategies

## REST API
üöÄ The backend will expose RESTful APIs for various functionalities such as user authentication, data retrieval, and manipulation. Detailed API documentation will be provided within the project.

## Entities
üîç The project will include entities representing different data objects used in the application. These entities will be mapped to the database tables using Spring Data JPA.

### Frontend
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **React Router**: A routing library for React.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

### Backend
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides repository support for Java applications.
- **Spring Security**: Authentication and authorization framework.
- **Spring Web**: Provides basic web functionalities.
